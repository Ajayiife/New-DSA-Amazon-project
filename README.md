 This amazon data visualization offers insight into product categories based on pricing, discount, rating, and customers reviews. It highlights top-rated and best selling categories, helping businesses identify key trends. However, a challenge remains in balancing competitive pricing with customer satisfaction. Categories with high sales may not always have the best ratings, suggesting a need align product quality, pricing strategies, and customer expectations to drive both sales and brand trust.
The Amazon data visualization effectively highlights essential metrics across product categories. It gives a comprehensive overview of product distribution, discount trends, pricing, and customer feedback. Key observations include:
•	The "3m office item" stands out with the highest customer rating.
•	Home appliances dominate in terms of product volume and total reviews.
•	Office items receive the highest average discount, while home appliances have the highest actual and listed prices.
•	Review content is most prevalent among home appliances, indicating high consumer interaction.
Recommendations:
1.	Promote Office Items Aggressively: Leverage the high discount rates and top ratings to push more marketing and featured listings for office items. This could enhance sales and brand trust.
2.	Review Pricing Strategy for Home Appliances: Since these have high actual and listed prices, evaluate the price-to-value perception and consider promotional campaigns or bundling strategies to sustain competitiveness.
3.	Expand 'Others' Category: The "others" category has minimal products and reviews. Investigating customer needs in this segment may identify opportunities for niche product development or category expansion.
4.	Strengthen Review Engagement Across Categories: Product categories with lower review counts should be supported with review solicitation strategies such as post-purchase follow-ups or incentives for feedback to increase visibility and consumer trust
